# About

I'm a canadian computer science student, no need to know more let's skip to the interesting part

<br />
<br />


# This git hub profile is  more of a public note book 📕

### What does that mean ?

I always find myself trying to learn more about computer science, cyber-security, math, different programming languages, and so on.

For this reason, I will be structuring what I learn, into different reps and organizing the information into note with visual support explainations, and exemples

<br />
<br />

# ⚠ How to safely take advantages of the notes ⚠

### Flags for repos

- ✏ This is a repo with my notes, as I take them, there is not as much effort put into the presentation of the information 
- 📄 This is a repo, that contains both my personal notes as I go along and re-organized, and well presented notes in a seperate section covering the material
